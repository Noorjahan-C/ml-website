# Welcome 👋

This website is my **Machine Learning teaching capsule** — short, focused notes for:
- beginners,
- interdisciplinary learners,
- and quick revision before interviews or exams.

## How to Use These Notes

- Start with **Foundations** (NumPy and Pandas)
- Then move to **Supervised ML** (Regression, Classification, SVM, etc.)
- Use the left Table of Contents for quick navigation inside each page
- Use the top menu to jump between topics

## What is Machine Learning?

> Machine Learning is a field of AI where computers learn patterns from data and use them to make predictions or decisions, without being explicitly programmed for every rule.

### Basic Workflow

1. **Data** → collect and clean data
2. **Features** → convert raw data into useful numeric form
3. **Model** → choose and train an algorithm
4. **Evaluation** → check accuracy / error using metrics
5. **Deployment** → use the model on new, unseen data

### Types of ML Covered in This Site

- **Supervised learning**: Regression and Classification
- (You can later add)
  - Unsupervised learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
  - Model evaluation and regularization
  - Explainable AI (SHAP, etc.)

> Use this site along with Jupyter Notebook / VS Code so that you can **run all examples yourself**.
